## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run TubeTalk - YouTube Video Chat locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Hugging Face account with an API token
- A YouTube video with captions in a supported language (e.g., Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, English, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tubetalk-Youtube-Video-Chat.git
   cd Tubetalk-Youtube-Video-Chat
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes:

   ```
   streamlit
   streamlit-option-menu
   youtube-transcript-api
   langchain
   langchain-community
   sentence-transformers
   huggingface_hub
   faiss-cpu
   ```

4. **Set Up Hugging Face API Token**

   Create a `secrets.toml` file in the `.streamlit` directory (or directly in the project root for local runs):

   ```toml
   HF_API_TOKEN = "your-hugging-face-api-token"
   ```

   To get your token:
   - Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
   - Generate a new token with `read` access.

5. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìñ Usage

1. **Navigate to the Chat Page**:
   - Use the sidebar to select "Chat."
2. **Enter a YouTube URL**:
   - Paste a valid YouTube video URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`) to instantly view the video in the embedded player.
   - Ensure the video has captions in a supported language for transcript processing.
3. **Select a Language**:
   - Choose your preferred transcript language (e.g., Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, English) from the dropdown.
4. **Process the Transcript**:
   - Click "Process Video" to fetch and analyze the transcript. If the selected language is unavailable, the app will attempt other supported languages.
5. **Ask Questions**:
   - Type a question (e.g., "What is the main topic of the video?").
   - Click "Send" to get a response.
6. **View Transcript**:
   - Expand the "View Transcript" section to see the full transcript after processing.
7. **Manage Chat**:
   - **Clear Chat**: Reset the chat history.
   - **Download Chat**: Save the chat history as a Markdown file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Video Playback**:
   - The app extracts the video ID from the YouTube URL using regex patterns as soon as the URL is pasted.
   - The video is displayed instantly in an embedded player using Streamlit‚Äôs iframe component.
2. **Transcript Fetching**:
   - When "Process Video" is clicked, the `YouTubeTranscriptApi` fetches the transcript in the user‚Äôs preferred language (e.g., Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi) or falls back to other supported languages.
3. **Text Processing**:
   - The transcript is split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
   - Chunks are embedded using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
   - Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.
4. **Question Answering**:
   - User questions are processed using a LangChain retrieval chain.
   - Relevant transcript chunks are retrieved and passed to the Hugging Face Inference API (`mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`).
   - Responses are formatted in Markdown with sections like **Key Points**.
5. **UI Rendering**:
   - Streamlit renders the video player, transcript, chat history, and responses.
   - Custom CSS styles buttons for a polished look.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Invalid YouTube URL**:
  - Ensure the URL is correct and includes the video ID (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`).
  - If the video doesn‚Äôt display, verify the URL format and try again.
- **No Transcript Available**:
  - Verify the video has captions in a supported language (e.g., Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, English).
- **API Errors**:
  - **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Wait and try again, or check your Hugging Face plan.
  - **Invalid Token**: Ensure `HF_API_TOKEN` is correct in `secrets.toml`.
  - **Service Unavailable**: Hugging Face servers may be down; try later.
- **Processing Errors**:
  - Enable "Debug Mode" in the sidebar to view detailed logs.
  - Check console output for specific error messages.
- **Language Issues**:
  - If the selected language is unavailable, the app will attempt other languages. Ensure captions exist for the video.
